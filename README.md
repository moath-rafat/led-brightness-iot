# LED Brightness IoT
Embedded IoT system for LED brightness control with web dashboard visualization for the brightness percentage. The user changes the LED Brightness by using a potentiometer knob, then STM32F407 samples the potentiometer value and controls the brightness via pwm, with every new value the stm sends via UART the brightness percentage to esp32 for it to send the value to a web dashboard
